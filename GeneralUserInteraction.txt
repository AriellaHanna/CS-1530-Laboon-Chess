General User Interaction with Laboon Chess:

The user will first launch the chess game from where ever they have it stored on their computer. Upon launching the game,
the user will be presented with the game screen and a pop-up screen that asks them whether they would like to be white
or black. Next the user will be taken to the game screen and will be able to play by clicking on their pieces and moving
them to valid spaces on the board, per American chess rules. The user will be alerted if they try to make an invalid move.
Should the user want to start over, they will be able to press the "New Game" button at the bottom of the screen. 
If they would like to save a game or load a previous game, the user will be able to press the "Save Game" or "Load Game"
buttons, respectively.
